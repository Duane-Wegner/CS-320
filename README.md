**CS-320 Software Test, Automation QA**

**Project Portfolio Overview:**
This portfolio contains files from two projects that demonstrate my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. These include:

Project One: Contact Service
      Files included: Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, and ContactServiceTest.java.
      Demonstrates unit testing, error detection, and adherence to requirements.

Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report
     Highlights my ability to analyze and apply various software testing strategies and document the learning process.

**Reflections on My Work:**
     How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality, I focus on thorough testing through unit tests and continuous integration tools. Writing comprehensive tests such as those in ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java helped uncover potential bugs early and ensured that the code met requirements. Security is achieved by adhering to best practices, such as validating inputs, minimizing dependencies, and following secure coding standards. For example, in the Contact Service project, input validation ensured data integrity and prevented common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
     Interpreting user needs starts with clearly understanding the project requirements and breaking them down into actionable development goals. I rely on user stories, feedback, and requirement documentation to guide my approach. For the Contact Service project, this meant creating a service that met specific functional requirements, such as storing and managing contact information while ensuring ease of use and scalability. Incorporating user needs into design decisions ensures the program remains practical and user-friendly.

How do I approach designing software?
     My approach to software design is iterative and requirements-driven. I start by analyzing requirements and then draft a modular design that ensures scalability and maintainability. For instance, in the Contact Service project, I used object-oriented principles to create reusable and maintainable code. My design process involves breaking down tasks into smaller, testable components, ensuring that each part integrates seamlessly into the larger system.
